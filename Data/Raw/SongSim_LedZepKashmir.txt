Oh let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dreamI am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I have beenTo sit with elders of the gentle race, this world has seldom seenThey talk of days for which they sit and wait and all will be revealed
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace, whose sounds caress my earBut not a word I heard could I relate, the story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, I been flying... mama, there ain't no denyin'I've been flying, ain't no denyin', no denyin'
All I see turns to brown, as the sun burns the groundAnd my eyes fill with sand, as I scan this wasted landTrying to find, trying to find where I've been.
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace, like thoughts inside a dreamHeed the path that led me to that place, yellow desert streamMy Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return againSure as the dust that floats high in June, when movin' through Kashmir.
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails, across the sea of yearsWith no provision but an open face, along the straits of fear
Oh
When I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeahWhen I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down...Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, well I'm down, so downOoh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there
Let me take you there. Let me take you there
